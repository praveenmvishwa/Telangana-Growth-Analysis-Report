)
This process assumes that you have a 'fact_Stamps' table with columns like 'doument_resistered_rev', 'estamps_challen_rev', 'FiscalYear', and 'Significantly More Flag'. You may need to adjust column names and table names based on your actual data model.

The above steps will help you compare the revenue generated from document registration to the revenue generated from e-stamp challans across districts and identify the top 5 districts where e-stamps revenue contributes significantly more to the revenue than document registration in FY 2022. Adjust the percentage threshold in the "Significantly More Flag" calculation according to your business requirements.

asume i have table like fact_Stamps in conteind column doument_registerd_cnt , doument_resistered_rev,estamps_challans_cnt,estamps_challen_rev,
estamps_challen_rev column is it 0 value how find the estamps_challen_rev in dax formula

If you want to handle cases where the 'estamps_challen_rev' column has a value of 0 in Power BI using DAX formulas, you can use the following approach:

Create a new calculated column that replaces 0 values in the 'estamps_challen_rev' column with a null or blank value.
dax
Copy code
Adjusted E-Stamps Revenue = IF('fact_Stamps'[estamps_challen_rev] = 0, BLANK(), 'fact_Stamps'[estamps_challen_rev])
Now, you can use the 'Adjusted E-Stamps Revenue' column in your calculations. For example, if you want to calculate the total e-stamps revenue without considering the 0 values:
dax
Copy code
Total Adjusted E-Stamps Revenue = SUM('fact_Stamps'[Adjusted E-Stamps Revenue])
This way, you can handle the 0 values in the 'estamps_challen_rev' column by replacing them with BLANK() and then use the adjusted column in your calculations.
